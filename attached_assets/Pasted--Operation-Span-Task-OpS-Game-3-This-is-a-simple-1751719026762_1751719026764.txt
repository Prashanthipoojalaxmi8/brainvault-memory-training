"""
🧠 Operation Span Task (OpS) - Game 3
--------------------------------------
This is a simple memory + math challenge game to test working memory.

🌟 What does it test?
Your ability to:
1. Solve a math problem
2. Remember a word shown with it
3. After a few such pairs, recall all the words in the correct order

🔁 This game includes 3 levels:
- Level 1: Easy (basic addition/subtraction)
- Level 2: Medium (multiplication and small division)
- Level 3: Mixed (slightly more complex but still manageable)

🧩 What you’ll do:
1. Solve the given math problem
2. A word will be shown—remember it!
3. After 3 rounds, you’ll be asked to recall all the words IN ORDER

🎯 Example:
Math: (3 + 2) = ?  ➜ You answer: 5  
Word: "Apple" ➜ You remember it  
Do this 3 times  
Then: “Tell the words in order” ➜ You type: Apple, Chair, Tree

✅ Goal: Solve + Remember = WIN!

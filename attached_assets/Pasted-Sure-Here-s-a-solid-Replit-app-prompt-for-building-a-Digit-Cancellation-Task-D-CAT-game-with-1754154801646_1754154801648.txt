Sure! Here's a solid Replit app prompt for building a **Digit Cancellation Task (D-CAT)** game, with increasing difficulty, scoring, and optional cognitive twists. You can copy-paste this directly into Replit‚Äôs ‚ÄúCreate Repl‚Äù ‚Üí ‚ÄúPrompt‚Äù section:

### üî¢ **Digit Cancellation Task (D-CAT) ‚Äì Cognitive Focus Game App**

**Prompt:**

> Build a browser-based **Digit Cancellation Task** game to assess and train attention. The app should display a grid of randomly generated digits. The user must cancel (click) on specific target digits as quickly and accurately as possible within a time limit.

---

### ‚úÖ **Core Features**:

1. **Grid Generator**:

   * Display digits in a grid layout (e.g., 10x10).
   * Digits should be randomly generated (0‚Äì9).

2. **Target Selection**:

   * Randomly choose 1‚Äì3 target digits per level.
   * Display target(s) clearly at the top.

3. **Click-to-Cancel**:

   * Users click on digits to cancel them.
   * Clicked digits change color or get crossed out.

4. **Scoring System**:

   * **Hits**: Correct target digits clicked.
   * **Misses**: Targets that were not clicked.
   * **False Positives**: Non-targets that were clicked.
   * Display accuracy and speed score after each round.

5. **Timer**:

   * Limit each round to 60 seconds (configurable).
   * Optional: Add a countdown visual or sound beep at the end.

### üîº **Difficulty Levels** (Optional Advanced Mode):

* Level 1: 1 target digit, 10x10 grid.
* Level 2: 2 target digits, 15x15 grid.
* Level 3: 3 target digits, 20x20 grid + distractors.
* Level 4: Same as above + time limit = 30s.
* Level 5: Add a **secondary task** (e.g., play sound every 10s, user clicks spacebar when heard).

---

### üé® **Visual Options**:

* Use light-colored background with high-contrast digits.
* Optional toggle: ‚ÄúNoisy background‚Äù mode with faint patterns.
* Animations when digits are canceled (e.g., fade or pop effect).

---

### üß† **Extra Features** (For bonus cognitive challenge):

* **Target-switching mode**: Mid-game, the target digit changes (alert user visually).
* **Inhibition mode**: User must cancel **all digits except** the target digit(s).
* **Symbol/Letter Mode**: Swap digits with letters or shapes for generalization.

---

### üîß **Tech Stack Suggestions**:

* **Frontend**: HTML, CSS (Tailwind or custom), JavaScript (Vanilla or React.js)
* **Backend/Storage** (Optional): Store scores with Firebase or localStorage
* **Audio**: Add feedback sounds for clicks, timeouts, or errors
